Hello! I am thebigsleepjoe (Joe/TBSJ), a software developer and modder. I am an IT technician by trade, but I have been programming small projects for close to a decade.

I mainly develop mods for video games and tinker with creating automated players for various titles.

My best known project is the [TTT Bots](https://github.com/thebigsleepjoe/TTT-Bots-2), a project that adds fully automated players
to the social deduction game Trouble in Terrorist Town, a gamemode for Garry's Mod.
